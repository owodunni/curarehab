## Release

Create a GitHub Release this will trigger a merge into the Release branch. The release branch automatically triggers a CloudFlare pages deployment
to production.

## SEO

We want to get good search rankings. There are a couple of tools that we use to check the SEO of the site.

- [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console?resource_id=sc-domain%3Acurarehab.se) - This is the main tool for checking the SEO of the site. It will show you
  how Google sees the site and what issues it has with the site.
- [Webmaster](https://www.bing.com/webmasters?siteUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fcurarehab.se%2F) - Shows how Bing sees the site.
- [Google Lighthouse](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-curarehab-se/7k96u87w6t) to check the SEO and performance of the site.

## Analytics

We also use [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/) to track the traffic to the site.
